CS_Adventure_Game_Project
This is a project for my Computer Science class. It isn't based on any pre-existing media, but I hope you enjoy it upon completion!
Note:
 - To equip a new item, you must purchase it again from the correlating merchant. This goes for any equipment that you have replaced with a new purchase.
 - This is for Replit only, running it locally will print ANSI escape codes as strings.
 - Try to keep your inputs accurate, I haven't implemented much beyond minimal error handling, so you may have to restart if you mess up.
 - This game isn't meant to be hard, but rather just a showcase of certain skills
